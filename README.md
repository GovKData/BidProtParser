# BidProtParser
This is a program for extracting data from GAO Bid Protests and 
##  is roughly formatted to extract data from other potential sources.

The program file walks through each step via in-line comments. 

The in-file description is a good faith effort to make it clear, 
##  but in the event it is not or for more information, feel free 
##  to email GovKData@Gmail.com.
